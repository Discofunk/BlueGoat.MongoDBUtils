# BlueGoat Mongo Utils

This .NET Tool provides some utilities that can be useful during a project's development phase when working with MongoDB and can do the following:

- Dropping a DB
- Checking the health of a DB
- Running a [MongoDBMigrations](https://bitbucket.org/i_am_a_kernel/mongodbmigrations) migration
- Saving/Loading scenario data

As a testing aid, you can save the current state of the DB as a scenario JSON file and load it back in again. This is useful for quickly testing against various data states and sharing data states with the team.

> âš  Warning: This is not intended as a way to back up / restore large amounts of data but rather manage various light-weight scenarios for a small amount of data. The scenario commands will attempt to dump / restore the entire DB using an inefficient JSON file format.

This is a work in progress and has not had any production exposure but I thought I would share it as it has been useful for me.

### Thanks

This utility uses the excellent MongoDBMigrations project - https://bitbucket.org/i_am_a_kernel/mongodbmigrations

### Current Version and Dependency Versions

Mongo Utils (this): `0.0.10`
MongoDBMigrations: `2.2.0`
MongoDB.Driver: `2.24.0`

Release Notes: https://github.com/Discofunk/BlueGoat.MongoDBUtils/releases

### Limitations

Currently dependencies are packaged with this utility at a specific version which may cause issues if you are using an older MongoDBMigrations version or your MongoDB database is not compatible with the current driver being used.

### What's New?

Added option to select MongoDB `GuidRepresentationMode` and `GuidRepresentation` when loading & saving scenario data to maintain expected format after loading. For more information see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/current/fundamentals/serialization/guid-serialization/

Examples:

```console
mongo-utils scenario load -c mongodb://root:BlueGoatsFlyFaster@localhost:27017 -db "MyMongoDB" --in .\ModelData\BasicScenario.json --guid-mode V3
```
