# BlueGoat Mongo Utils

This .NET Tool provides some utilities that can be useful during a project's development phase when working with MongoDB and can do the following:

- Dropping a DB
- Checking the health of a DB
- Running a [MongoDBMigrations](https://bitbucket.org/i_am_a_kernel/mongodbmigrations) migration
- Saving/Loading scenario data

As testing aid, you can save the current state of the DB as a scenario JSON file and load it back in again. This is useful for quickly testing against various data states.

> âš  Warning: This is not intended as a way to back up / restore large amounts of data but rather manage various light-weight scenarios for a small amount of data. The scenario commands will attempt to dump / restore the entire DB using an inefficient JSON file format.

This is a work in progress and has not had any production exposure but I thought I would share it as it has been useful for me.

### Thanks

This utility uses the excellent MongoDBMigrations project - https://bitbucket.org/i_am_a_kernel/mongodbmigrations
